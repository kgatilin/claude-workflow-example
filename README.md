# AI Coding Agent Workflow for MCP Server Development

This project showcases a structured coding agent workflow using Claude to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Jira issue retrieval. It demonstrates how to leverage AI agents to streamline development through standardized commands and task management.

## What is an MCP Server?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a system that allows AI agents to securely interact with tools and services, giving Claude "hands" to work with your local files, GitHub repositories, databases, and external APIs. An MCP server provides standardized access to specific functionality - in this case, retrieving Jira issue information.

MCP servers enable AI agents to:
- Access real-time data from external services
- Perform actions on behalf of users through standardized interfaces
- Integrate with existing tools and workflows securely
- Provide context-aware assistance based on live data

## How to Use the Workflow

This project implements a structured workflow with five main commands that guide you through implementing an MCP server from requirements to completion.

### Command Sequence

**This is a collaborative human-AI workflow, not automation.** Each command must be manually invoked by you after reviewing the previous stage's output. The AI assistant accelerates development by 10x while you maintain complete control over when and how to proceed.

**First, launch Claude Code in your project directory:**
```bash
cd your-project-directory
claude
```

**Then execute the workflow with human oversight at each stage:**

```bash
# 1. Initialize task from backlog
/workflow:init_task @.agent/backlog/jira-get-issue-mcp.md
```
üìã **Review & Decide:** Examine the generated business requirements in `00_task.md`. Validate acceptance criteria, modify requirements if needed. When satisfied, run the next command.

```bash
# 2. Create implementation plan
/workflow:plan
```
üèóÔ∏è **Review & Decide:** Examine the technical plan in `01_implementation_plan.md`. Verify architecture decisions, assess complexity, adjust approach if needed. When the strategy looks good, proceed to implementation.

```bash
# 3. Implement the feature with TDD
/workflow:implement
```
‚ö° **Review & Decide:** Test the implementation, run the code, verify functionality matches requirements. The AI builds fast, but you ensure it builds right. When ready, run the review.

```bash
# 4. Review implementation against requirements
/workflow:review [additional-focus-areas]
```
üîç **Review & Decide:** Evaluate the comprehensive review findings in `03_review.md`. If fixes are needed, run the fix command. If satisfied, you're done.

```bash
# 5. Fix any issues found in review (if needed)
/workflow:review_fix
```
‚úÖ **Review & Decide:** Validate that fixes address the identified issues without introducing new problems. Repeat review cycle as needed.

**Key Principles:**
- **Human judgment drives decisions** - AI provides options, you choose the path
- **Review every output** - Fast generation requires careful validation
- **Iterative improvement** - Use feedback to refine results at each stage
- **Quality gate enforcement** - Don't proceed until each stage meets your standards

### Command Descriptions

#### 1. `/workflow:init_task` - Task Initialization
