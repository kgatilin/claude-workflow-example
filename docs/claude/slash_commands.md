# Slash commands

> Control Claude's behavior during an interactive session with slash commands.

## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

### Syntax

```
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension) |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                          |

### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(project)" after their description.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`

In the following example, we create the `/optimize` command:

```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(user)" after their description.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`

In the following example, we create the `/security-review` command:

```bash
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Features

#### Namespacing

Organize commands in subdirectories. The subdirectories are used for organization and appear in the command description, but they do not affect the command name itself. The description will show whether the command comes from the project directory (`.claude/commands`) or the user-level directory (`~/.claude/commands`), along with the subdirectory name.

Conflicts between user and project level commands are not supported. Otherwise, multiple commands with the same base file name can coexist.

For example, a file at `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates the command `/component` with description showing "(project:frontend)".
Meanwhile, a file at `~/.claude/commands/component.md` creates the command `/component` with description showing "(user)".

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using argument placeholders:

##### All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`

The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures all arguments passed to the command:

```bash
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /fix-issue 123 high-priority
# $ARGUMENTS becomes: "123 high-priority"
```

##### Individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc.

Access specific arguments individually using positional parameters (similar to shell scripts):

```bash
# Command definition  
echo 'Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3' > .claude/commands/review-pr.md

# Usage
> /review-pr 456 high alice
# $1 becomes "456", $2 becomes "high", $3 becomes "alice"
```

Use positional arguments when you need to:

* Access arguments individually in different parts of your command
* Provide defaults for missing arguments
* Build more structured commands with specific parameter roles

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context. You *must* include `allowed-tools` with the `Bash` tool, but you can choose the specific bash commands to allow.

For example:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown
# Reference a specific file

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files

Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### Frontmatter

Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command:

| Frontmatter                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                               | Default                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| `allowed-tools`            | List of tools the command can use                                                                                                                                                     | Inherits from the conversation      |
| `argument-hint`            | The arguments expected for the slash command. Example: `argument-hint: add [tagId] \| remove [tagId] \| list`. This hint is shown to the user when auto-completing the slash command. | None                                |
| `description`              | Brief description of the command                                                                                                                                                      | Uses the first line from the prompt |
| `model`                    | Specific model string (see [Models overview](/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview))                                                                                                  | Inherits from the conversation      |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Whether to prevent `SlashCommand` tool from calling this command                                                                                                                      | false                               |

For example:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
argument-hint: [message]
description: Create a git commit
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
```

Example using positional arguments:

```markdown
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
Focus on security, performance, and code style.
```

## `SlashCommand` tool

The `SlashCommand` tool allows Claude to execute [custom slash commands](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) programmatically
during a conversation. This gives Claude the ability to invoke custom commands
on your behalf when appropriate.

To encourage Claude to trigger `SlashCommand` tool, your instructions (prompts,
CLAUDE.md, etc.) generally need to reference the command by name with its slash.

Example:

```
> Run /write-unit-test when you are about to start writing tests.
```

This tool puts each available custom slash command's metadata into context up to the
character budget limit. You can use `/context` to monitor token usage and follow
the operations below to manage `SlashCommand` tool context.

Currently, `SlashCommand` tool does not support built-in commands like `/compact`.

### Disable `SlashCommand` tool

To prevent Claude from executing any slash commands via the tool:

```bash
/permissions
# Add to deny rules: SlashCommand
```

This will also remove SlashCommand tool (and the slash command descriptions) from context.

### Disable specific commands only

To prevent a specific slash command from becoming available, add
`disable-model-invocation: true` to the slash command's frontmatter.

This will also remove the command's metadata from context.

### `SlashCommand` permission rules

The permission rules support:

* **Exact match**: `SlashCommand:/commit` (allows only `/commit` with no arguments)
* **Prefix match**: `SlashCommand:/review-pr:*` (allows `/review-pr` with any arguments)

### Character budget limit

The `SlashCommand` tool includes a character budget to limit the size of command
descriptions shown to Claude. This prevents token overflow when many commands
are available.

The budget includes each custom slash command's name, args, and description.

* **Default limit**: 15,000 characters
* **Custom limit**: Set via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable

When the character budget is exceeded, Claude will see only a subset of the
available commands. In `/context`, a warning will show with "M of N commands".
